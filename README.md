# Multi-factor-Safe-Speed-Estimation
This project presents a dynamic speed limit estimation system that relies on monocular camera data to provide real-time, situation-specific safe speed recommendations for vehicles. The system is designed to improve vehicle safety by adapting to changing road conditions, especially where static speed limits are insufficient or non-existent.
